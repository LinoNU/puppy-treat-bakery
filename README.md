## About

In Puppy Treat Bakery, players run a bakery that makes treats for puppies. Fractions represent batches of treats, and players must convert between improper fractions and mixed numbers to correctly package orders for adorable puppy customers.

The visual metaphor makes fractions intuitive:
- **Full boxes** = whole numbers
- **Individual treats** = the fractional part

## Features

- 🔄 **Three game modes:**
  - Improper → Mixed (e.g., 7/3 → 2⅓)
  - Mixed → Improper (e.g., 2½ → 5/2)
  - Mix It Up! (random problems)

- 📊 **Three difficulty levels:**
  - Easy (small numbers, denominators 2-4)
  - Medium (moderate numbers, denominators 2-6)
  - Hard (larger numbers, denominators 3-10)

- 💡 **Visual hints** showing treats in boxes to help understand the conversion

- 🎮 **Gamification elements:**
  - Score tracking
  - Streak bonuses for consecutive correct answers
  - Puppy Points system
  - Unlock new puppy characters as you earn points

- 🎉 **Fun feedback:**
  - Animated puppies that celebrate or encourage
  - Confetti for correct answers
  - Silly puppy sayings
